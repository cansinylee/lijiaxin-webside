This is a simple front-end website created as part of an online course focused on front-end development skills. The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and a small amount of JavaScript for interactivity.

# Feature

- HTML: Used to structure the webpage, including text, forms, and media elements.
- CSS: Provides the design and layout, using techniques like Flexbox and Grid to ensure responsive design.
- JavaScript: Adds basic interactivity (e.g., form validation, dynamic behavior).
